(header) I am a computer scientist who believes that quality is everything.

Hey there! My name is Ahmad and I am a second-year computer science student studying in the DMV area.

I have been programming for over 4 years now (since 2018), and although my main focus is computer science, I am also self-taught in full stack web development (front-end and back-end). I am currently looking to use my problem solving skills as either a freelancer or in a software development role.

If you would like to reach out to me about a potential project or job opportunity, feel free to check out my contact section below!
